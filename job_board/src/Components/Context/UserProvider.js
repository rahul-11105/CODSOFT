Bei PersoQua könnten wir genau den richtigen Nährboden für deine Ambitionen bieten. Wie wäre es, wenn du der Motor für wichtige gesellschaftliche Prozesse sein könntest und gleichzeitig mit uns wächst?\n\nStell dir eine Welt vor, in der Menschen ihre Arbeitszeit nutzen, um sich und ihr Potenzial voll zu entfalten – wir bei PersoQua arbeiten genau auf diese Vision hin. Wir unterstützen Unternehmen beim Bezug finanzieller Förderungen, die es ihren Mitarbeitern erlauben sich in ihrer Arbeitszeit Themen wie gesundem Angstmanagement, einfühlsamer Kommunikation und kreativer Gestaltungsfreiheit zu widmen. Klingt das nicht nach einem Game-Changer?\n\nUnternehmen, die es verstanden haben, bekommen durch uns einen riesigen finanziellen Rückenwind!\n\nIn unserem kleinen aber feinen Team zählt jeder Einzelne. Wir haben uns darauf spezialisiert, den Fluss von staatlichen Zuschüssen an Unternehmen für Neueinstellungen und fachlichen sowie persönlichen Weiterbildungen von bestehenden Mitarbeitenden zu vereinfachen.\n\n<strong>Aufgaben</strong>\n\nBei PersoQua verstehen wir den Wert starker und nachhaltiger Beziehungen. Als expandierendes Unternehmen, das mit Arbeitgebern, fördernden Stellen und Bildungsträgern zusammenarbeitet, suchen wir engagierte Mitarbeitende, die unsere Bestandskunden betreuen, Förderanträge stellen, die Beziehungen zu unseren Partnern stärken und zum weiteren Wachstum unseres Unternehmens beitragen.\n\n<strong>Qualifikation</strong>\n\nDu bist es gewohnt als B2B-Dienstleister, mit Personalabteilungen und Geschäftsführungen jeder Größe in lockerer, professioneller Atmosphäre und auf Augenhöhe zu kommunizieren. Du fühlst dich in der Businessetikette zu Hause und strebst nicht nur danach Kunden zufriedenzustellen, sondern sie zu begeistern.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Du denkst in skalierbaren Prozessen!</li>\n</ul>\nAuch wenn du keine Star-Allüren hast und hands-on anpackst, strebst du danach skalierbare Prozesse zu etablieren und sie kontinuierlich zu verbessern, sodass es dir möglich wird ein großes, herausragendes & leistungsfähiges Team zu unterstützen und zu führen.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Du gehst gerne die extra Meile!</li>\n</ul>\nSportlicher und mentaler Ausgleich wird von uns erwartet und gefördert. Innerhalb eines gesunden Rahmens wird es allerdings in den nächsten 1-2 Jahren sinnvoll sein, nicht pünktlich nach 40 Stunden den Stift fallen zu lassen. Erst mal ist Vollgas gefragt.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Du möchtest an etwas Großem mitwirken!</li>\n</ul>\nDu bist motiviert bis in die Zehenspitzen und brauchst keine Impulse von außen. Du begeisterst dich und andere von Dingen, hinter denen du uneingeschränkt stehen kannst.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Zufriedene Kunden? Du gehst einen Schritt weiter!</li>\n</ul>\nDu unterstützt unsere Bestandskunden auf ihrem Weg zur optimalen Personalförderung. Deine Aufgabe ist es, in allen Fragen rund um die Personalförderung zu beraten und den Aufwand der Beantragung beim Kunden möglichst gering zu halten. Zudem übernimmst du die vollständige Abwicklung der Förderanträge. Die Formularbearbeitung wird schrittweise immer weiter automatisiert. Du wirst vor allem Kontakt zu Geschäftsführungen, Personalabteilungen, Bildungsträgern und Behörden haben. Durch deinen zuvorkommenden und professionellen Serviceanspruch, dem du schaffst, dauerhaft gerecht zu werden, bist du bald für unsere Kunden nicht mehr wegzudenken.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Deine Lernfreude treibt dich an</li>\n</ul>\nDu wirst nicht nur eine externe Zertifizierung zum_r Fördermittelmanager_in durchlaufen, sondern vor allem durch unsere Erfahrung einen einzigartigen Einblick in die Förderlandschaft der Personalförderungen erhalten. Während deiner Einarbeitung wirst du dich mit verschiedenen Fördertöpfen, deren Richtlinien und Abläufen so auseinandersetzen, dass das Wissen in Fleisch und Blut übergeht. Dadurch wirst du spielerisch und spontan auf die Fragen und Anwendungsfälle unserer Kunden eingehen können.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Du suchst stets nach Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten</li>\n</ul>\nUnser aktuell noch kleines Team wird wachsen und braucht dann Leute, die kooperativ unterstützen und führen.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Du schätzt Flexibilität</li>\n</ul>\nDie Freiheit von ortsunabhängigem Arbeiten kannst du genießen. Wir haben zwar ein Gemeinschaftsbüro mit einem beeindruckenden Ausblick über Berlin (wow-Effekt garantiert), doch deine Arbeit kann fast vollständig von zu Hause ausgeführt werden.\n\nBenefits\n<ul>\n \t<li>Du investierst deine Zeit und Energie, was investiert PersoQua?</li>\n</ul>\nBedeutsamkeit in der Tätigkeit und ein ansprechendes Einkommenspaket: Festgehalt, Leistungsboni und Unternehmensanteile. Welche Höhen und Aufteilungen würden dich begeistern? Auch wenn wir noch sehr am Anfang unserer Reise sind, darf der Weg auch finanziell Spaß machen.\n\nVon uns bekommst du das Fachwissen, den finanziellen Rahmen und die Möglichkeit etwas wirklich Großes mitzugestalten, aber wir brauchen von dir deine volle Aufmerksamkeit und Einsatzbereitschaft – bist du dafür bereit?\n\nMir ist es egal, ob du promoviert hast oder nie dazu gekommen bist, eine Ausbildung abzuschließen. Die Frage ist, hast du das Feuer und die Erfahrung, die wir brauchen?\n\nWir wollen, dass du und PersoQua an dieser Zusammenarbeit wachsen!\n\nSolltest du dich angesprochen fühlen, aber die beschriebene Rolle nicht passen, kontaktiere mich trotzdem, denn wir werden noch viele verschiedene Positionen besetzen und vielleicht ist da ja etwas für dich dabei.\n\nWenn du bis hierhin gelesen hast, dann bist du vermutlich im positiven Sinne verrückt genug, etwas wirklich Großes anzugehen und deine Zeit und Energie dafür aufzubringen. Solltest du dich nicht bei mir melden, hoffe ich, dass du nicht aufhörst, nach einem anderen großartigen Unternehmen/Projekt zu suchen, in dem du dein Potenzial entfalten wirst.",
